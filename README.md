## Description

my motivation for this project was pretty simple really, this is something i would enjoy learning and i had a lot of ups and downs and the class hasnt even started. i feel accomplished and im really glad i pushed through and used resources to help when i had issues. this application solves the problem of having to go through the notes and find the specific things i want to study and learn better. i learned a lot during this pre work pretty much all of it was new to me, i learned javascript, html, CSS, and so much more.
